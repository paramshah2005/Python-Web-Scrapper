# Python Web Scrapper 

## 📌 Introduction  
This project focuses on building Python-based web scrapers to extract and analyze data from online car marketplaces. It enables the collection of structured datasets from websites, which can then be used for research, insights, and decision-making in the used car market.  

## 📂 About the Project  
The repository contains scrapers and analysis tools for two platforms:  

- **Cars24 Scraper** – Extracts car details such as model, year, mileage, and price, saving them in CSV format.  
- **Ackodrive Scraper** – Gathers listings from the Ackodrive website for comparison and trend analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – A notebook that leverages the Cars24 dataset (`cars24.csv`) to visualize patterns like pricing trends and car availability.  

By combining scraping and analysis, the project demonstrates the full workflow of **data acquisition → cleaning → visualization**.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python 3** – Core programming language.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive development and analysis.  
- **Requests** – Fetching static web pages.  
- **BeautifulSoup4** – Parsing and extracting information from HTML.  
- **Selenium** – Automating browsers and handling infinite scrolling/dynamic content.  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations for EDA.
